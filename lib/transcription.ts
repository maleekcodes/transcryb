And just generally to have like not a zero-sum mindset or like have more of a grow-the-pie mindset. Like the, if you sort of say like when we see people like perhaps including some very smart people kind of taking an attitude of like doing things that seem like morally questionable. It's often because they have at a base sort of axiomatic level a zero-sum mindset. And they, without realizing it, they don't realize they have a zero-sum mindset. Or at least they don't realize it consciously. And so if you have a zero-sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking things from others. If it's like, if the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie is to take someone else's pie. But this is false. Like obviously the pie has grown dramatically over time, the economic pie. So. Yeah. In reality, you can have the, so overuse this analogy. We have a lot of, there's a lot of pie. Yeah. Pie is not fixed. So you really want to make sure you don't, you're not operating without realizing it from a zero-sum mindset. Where the only way to get ahead is to take things from others. Then that's going to result in you trying to take things from others, which is not good. It's much better to work on adding to the economic pie. Maybe, you know, so, you know, creating, like I said, creating more than you consume, doing more than you, yeah. So that's, that's a big deal. I think there's like, you know, a fair number of people in, in finance that do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset.",

I mean, it, every, like the, the resource, the resources become less scarce. And that, that applies in a lot of kinds of domains. It applies in academia where a lot of people are very, see some funding for academic research is zero-sum. It is not. If you celebrate each other, if you make, if you get, everybody to be excited about AI, about physics, about mathematics, I think it, there'll be more and more funding and I think everybody wins.
